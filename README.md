# Ways to improve model performance

Model-centric approach:

We could fine tune the model to make use of the dropped varialbes in the Common Voice dataset, perhaps increasing performance. Variables such as "accent", "age" and "gender" could prove useful.

Data-centric approach:

To improve our model performance by finding other datasets that could provide more speeches, more complex samples and more various voices (e.g. people from different age, or with different accents). 
A dataset that could improve the model performances is the CETUC dataset. It contains around 145 hours of Portuguese distributed between 50 men and 50 women. Each person pronounces close to 1,000 phonetically balanced sentences.

Another dataset is the Multilingual Librispeech (MLS). It contains approximately 284 hours of Portuguese speech, obtained from 55 audiobooks read by 62 speakers.
